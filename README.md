# Reflections/Venting

This app was a great way to solidify React fundamentals and dip my toes into routing and testing. I can see there is a lot more to learn in these areas, but I feel confident that in future projects I will be able to apply the basics and build on top of them to achieve greater functionality. I also got to practice a little bit of CSS in the process, and had a lot of fun styling this one.
